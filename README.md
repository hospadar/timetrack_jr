# Timetrack Jr.

Small CLI utility to facilitate tracking the time it takes to do different activities (at work, for consultants, or whatever!).

Timetrack Jr. logs the start and end times of different activities to a local sqlite database and can export summaries of those time logs as csv, json, a text summary, or an .ical file (that you could pull into your favorite calendar tool)
